  <h1>The King's Crowning</h1>

  <p>
  <p>At the moment the Queen died, the throne passed immediately and without ceremony to the heir, Charles, the former
    Prince
    of Wales.

    But there are a number of practical - and traditional - steps which he must go through to be crowned King.</p>

  <h3>What will he be called?</h3>
  <p>He will be known as King Charles III.

    That was the first decision of the new king's reign. He could have chosen from any of his four names - Charles
    Philip Arthur George.

    He is not the only one who faces a change of title. Prince William and his wife Catherine are now titled Duke and

    Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge, and the king has conferred on them the title of Prince and Princess of Wales.

    There is also a new title for Charles' wife, Camilla, who becomes the Queen Consort - consort is the term used for
    the spouse of the monarch.</p>

  <h3>Formal ceremonies</h3>
  <p>Charles will be officially proclaimed King on Saturday. This will happen at St James's Palace in London, in front
    of
    a ceremonial body known as the Accession Council.

    This is made up of members of the Privy Council - a group of senior MPs, past and present, and peers - as well as
    some senior civil servants, Commonwealth high commissioners, and the Lord Mayor of London.</p>
